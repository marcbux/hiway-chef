% VARIANT-CALL
%
% This workflow differs from its original at https://github.com/joergen7/variant-call
% in the following ways:
% 
% (1) It does not build an index, but uses a pre-built index
% (2) It uses only a single (large) index
% (3) It assumes the fa, fai, index, and annodb to be present on all the worker nodes
% (4) It computes several samples, amounting to 1 TB of read input data
% (5) Read input data is zipped to conserve storage
% (6) it uses multithreading and memory boundaries
%
% A variant calling workflow.
%
% Sample data can be obtained from:
% ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG02025/sequence_read/
%
% The HG38 reference genome can be downloaded from
% http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/
%
% An Annovar HG38 database is expected to reside in
% /opt/data/annodb_hg38
%
% In addition to a Cuneiform interpreter the following tools need to be
% installed to run this analysis:
% - FastQC 0.11.4
% - Bowtie2 2.2.6
% - SAMtools 1.2
% - VarScan 2.3.9
% - Annovar
